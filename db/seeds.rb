First, you start off by going into a lunge with one leg bent in front and the other bent behind.  Next, slide carefully into your splits.  Hold each side for 1 minute (It helps if you put a timer on your phone).  Also make sure you do your middle splits for a minute as well.  Make sure that your legs are in a straight line when you stretch your middle splits (I use the wall as my 'ruler').  Once you have mastered the splits or want to improve more rapidly on your regular splits, try the oversplits (Picture of oversplits below).  This is when you have your front or back leg on a chair or any elevated surface and your slide into your splits.  Or in the case of the middle legs, put one leg on the chair/elevated surface and slide into your middles splits.  Hold each side for 1 minute.   This will help you improve your flexibility.  Hope it helps!"})

This exercise is like leg lifts, but with a dance twist.  Leg lifts is where you lie on your back and keep your lower back on the floor during the entire exercise.  You should have your legs straight up (Look at the picture above as an example).  When you lower your legs beat them using your innner thighs and pointe your toes.  On your way up, beat your legs using your inner thighs and flex your feet.  Repeat this 20 times.  Do this cycle 3 times! This will help your lower abs and Inner thighs! Good Luck gaining those six packs. "})

First, start in a normal bridge. You lay on your back and put your hands on the ground over your head. Then, push your pelvis up so your back is not on the ground.  Hold this bridge for at least 1 minute.  If you want more of a stretch, scootch your feet closer to your hands or vice versa.  Or you can try to straighten your legs (shown in the picture above).  Hope this helps!"})
